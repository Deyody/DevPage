    <p><h3><strong>Recipe</strong></h3></p>
    <p>To begin simply mix all the dry ingredients, excluding those for the sauce. This will wait in a bowl nearby, or can be done during the next process; Lightly pan-fry the diced chicken in some oil or butter until brown, it should be mostly cooked, to about 60%-70% doneness.</p>
    <p>Coat the cooked chicken in plain flour, salt and pepper if you'd like. Beat the egg, and use it to dredge this chicken, add the dredged cubes into the spiced flour, and pan fry again on a high heat until brown and crispy.</p>
    <p>After, take these out, and deglaze whatever is in the pan with the soy sauce, wait until it bubbles and caremelizes slightly, then add the orange juice. At this point you should mix in the other wet ingredients, garlic clove, and spices, into the pan, other than the Corn Starch Slurry, and 1 Tbsp. of Butter. Once the mixture has cooked down some, add the butter, and some of the slurry. You may want to use all of it, you may not, I would judge the consistency to preference, bearing in mind it will thicken slightly more once it's cooled to an eating temperature.</p>
    <p>Add in the chicken to the sauce and toss it, I'd also recommend dried chili, or to increase the spice quantities as you like!</p>
